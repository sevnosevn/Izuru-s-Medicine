    <h1>My Personal Assistant</h1>

    <p>I want to ask how and where to get big amounts of data.</p>
    <p>I'm interested in creating applications to help with mental helth and productivity.</p>
    <p>I'm very very interested in working with areas related to brain understanding. With doctors and scientists that map brain activity in certain situations.</p>
    <br>
    <p>This is a small project that I'm currently working on to help me make the most of my life and time and maybe even fight of my depression and blues</p>
    <p>I'd like to give my thanks to CodeCademy for everything they are teaching me so far. I have learning in a very <strong>fun</strong> and engaging way.</p>
